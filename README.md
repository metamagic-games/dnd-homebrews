# dnd-homebrews

This repo includes a collection of finished and work-in-progress homebrew content for D&D 5th Edition.

It includes both:
- Custom content presented as Player's Handbook-style documents, generated using [Handbooker](https://github.com/metamagic-games/handbooker).
- Code for use with the MorePurpleMoreBetter character creator.

## Getting started

### Generating the handbook content

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`

### Using this content with the [MPMB character sheet](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=more+purple+more+better+patreon&meta=)

When setting up you MPMB character sheet, there is an option to import a new file.
