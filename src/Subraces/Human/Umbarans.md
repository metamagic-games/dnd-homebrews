### Koramei

Koramei is the home of two great arcane traditions - the arcane college of wizards, and the great library of the magisters. These arcane experts, seeking future students, share some of their knowledge with young students, resulting in a population with uncommonly deep arcane insight.

In addition, Koramei is the heart of the Shield and is a large trade hub. Korameians are used to haggling and attempting to bend others to their will.

You gain the following benefits:

#### Lesser Ki

Your limited training at your local monastry allows you limited access to the Ki monks utilise, and some of their abilities. You gain Ki based on your character level (see below)

| Character level | Ki  |
| :-------------: | :-: |
|        1        |  1  |
|        8        |  2  |
|       16        |  3  |

If you are a monk, Ki points from this race feature cannot be used towards other monk features.

Ki can be spent on the following abilities:

- Patient Defense [1 ki point] - As a bonus action, I can take the Dodge action
- Step of the Wind [1 ki point] - As a bonus action, I can either Dash or Disengage; My jump distance doubles when I do so.
