### College Dust

College Dust is an unassuming grey powder, and is a waste product from enchantment spells. As relatively few in Umbara can enchant, it is fairly rare and expensive. It overwhelms the user’s mind with pure magical energies, and the user can see and manipulate the magical energies around them.

#### Effects

For 1 hour, you see magic around you, distorting your vision. You have the following effects:

- You can use Detect Magic at will
- Disadvantage on perception-based rolls
- You feel blissful - the magic is beautiful (unless it is necromantic, in which case you are terrified)

In addition, it gives the user a temporary cantrip for 24 hours. Roll 1d8 and gain a cantrip from the list below.

##### Cantrips

1. Acid Splash
2. Chill Touch
3. Fire Bolt
4. Light
5. Poison Spray
6. Produce Flame
7. Ray of Frost
8. Shocking Grasp

#### After use

- Gain 1 point of exhaustion
- Constitution save DC 10 to not get addicted.

If you become addicted, you gain one point of exhaustion which cannot be recovered through rest. If you go three days without taking it, the point of exhaustion is removed.

While addicted, if you have more college dust, you must take a wisdom saving throw (DC14) each day to resist taking it.

### Elixir

When gnomes lost access to the elven chalices of immortality, they began to try and create their own concoctions. They were partially successful.

Elixir is a very expensive gnomish potion that reduces the user’s effective age by one year, but sends them into a deep, dark depression stupor, incapacitating them for a day, and leaving them emotionally affected for a long while after. It is a clear liquid that refracts light, creating a prism-like effect.

#### Effects:

- You are 1 year younger
- You are in a stupor for 1 day
