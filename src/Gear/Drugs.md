## College Dust

College Dust is an unassuming grey powder, and is a waste product from enchantment spells. As relatively few in Umbara can enchant, it is fairly rare and expensive. It overwhelms the user’s mind with pure magical energies, and the user can see and manipulate the magical energies around them.

### Effects

- You see magic around you, distorting your vision
    - For one hour you can use Detect Magic at will
    - Disadvantage on perception-based rolls
    - You feel blissful - the magic is beautiful (unless it is necromantic, in which case you are terrified)

In addition, it gives the user a temporary cantrip for 24 hours. Roll 1d8 and gain a cantrip from the list below.

## Elixir

When gnomes lost access to the elven chalices of immortality, they began to try and create their own concoctions. They were partially successful. Elixir is a very expensive gnomish potion that reduces the user’s effective age by one year, but sends them into a deep, dark depression stupor, incapacitating them for a day, and leaving them emotionally affected for a long while after. It is a clear liquid that refracts light, creating a prism-like effect.

### Effects:
- You are 1 year younger
- You are in a stupor for 1 day

### After use
- Gain 1 point of exhaustion
- You are depressed
- Constitution save DC 10 to not get addicted.
