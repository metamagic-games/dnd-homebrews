A different command word can be spoken to have the boulder return to its smaller size over five minutes.

#### Cube of Captivation

This strange puzzle box has a many scattered bright squares of colors along its edges. A wielder may throw the box to an enemy and yell the command word to try and appeal to their deepest need to see a puzzle solved. They make a Wisdom save with DC 13. On a pass, they resist the box’s call. On a fail, they pick up the box and begin trying to unlock its mysteries. The creature is considered paralyzed while solving the box. At the end of each of that creature’s turns, they may make an Intelligence save with DC 13 to see if they successfully solve the puzzle, at which point they are freed from its terrifying hold. Any damage dealt to the creature solving the puzzle will break the captivation immediately. Once the Cube has been solved it cannot be scrambled again until the next morning. (This effect only works on creatures with an Intelligence Score of at least 7 and that have the physical capability to solve the puzzle.)
