# Serious Injuries

Serious injuries rules offer a way of making your combat encounters a little riskier, with long lasting consequences. Losing body parts, gaining injuries that linger, becoming crippled - these effects can have a serious impact on players' characters.

Players risk serious injury if they ever:

- Are downed
- Receive a critical hit

When either of the above occurs, they player must roll a DC 10 constitution saving throw. If they fail, roll a d100 on the table below.
