## Dark Madness

- You can go mad in the underdark, shadowfell, and shadow feywild
- Every time you take a short or long rest (outside of a settlement), take a wisdom saving throw. If you fail, you gain a level of madness
- Madness can be treated by long rest in safe locations
- You do not know you are suffering madness

| Level | Madness       | Madness effect                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Superstitious | You are superstitious and gain a strange behaviour - e.g. washing hands constantly, praying, walking in a particular rhythm, extreme attachment to an item, never stepping on cracks, checking oneâ€™s gun constantly, etc. |
| 2     | Fearful       | You are fearful. People have advantage on intimidation against you. You have disadvantage against charms that cause fear.                                                                                                 |
| 3     | Babbling      | You begin to hear voices and your own talking becomes incoherent. You have disadvantage on charisma-based checks. You understand abyssal, infernal, and primordial.                                                       |
| 4     | Amnesia       | You have amnesia. You temporarily forget one of your (prepared) spells at random.                                                                                                                                         |
| 5     | Paranoia      | You are paranoid. When you attack an enemy, and are adjacent to an ally, you must make a wisdom save, or attack the ally.                                                                                                 |
| 6     | Mad           | Your mind is distracted by a cacophony of maddening voices. You are functionally deaf, and have disadvantage on all perception rolls.                                                                                     |
