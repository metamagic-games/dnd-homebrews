# Pearl

_The days unaccounted for accrued slowly at first. I believe that is how they work - insidiously. My home is filled with ancient tomes written in languages I cannot comprehend, yet with accompanying notes made in my handwriting. And when the priests of Pelor prayed for my safety I could have sworn I heard a voice laughing._
_My mind is heavy and I fear these may be my last words. My body may wake up tomorrow in the clutches of them once again, and yet my thoughts lay dormant thereafter._
    - Quentin Ratley, _The Diary of Quentin Ratley_

Pearls are rare and elusive creatures, devoid of a body but with inscrutible minds filled with ancient knowledge of long forgotten kingdoms. 

### Parasitic Minds

Pearls lack a physical form. Instead, they can be found lurking within the minds of other beings. Seemingly not from any one place in particular, Pearls are a consistent phenomena across all planes containing sentient life. When they do manifest, they do so within the mind of a being, dormant at first but slowly growing in influence before eventually taking full control of their host.

The minds of the Pearl and their host cooexist in the same body, but the relationship between the Pearl and its host can either be collaborative or combative. Not wanting to risk being identified by the world around them, many Pearls only take control where they must, setting their host on a course and letting those events play out. Others tempt their host with power and wisdom, forming a relationship akin to a Warlock and their patron.

### A Timeless Perspective

Pearls can live well over 1000 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often academically interested than excited, though they can be paranoid and fearful for themselves. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When they do set their mind on a task, however, they will do so with singular focus, and may pursue one goal for millenia. 

They use people freely, form alliances slowly, and make friends only where they owe their life to someone. Those who do may benefit from their learnings, whilst those who wrong a Pearl spend the rest of their lives looking behind their back, never trusting those around them until the day the die.

### Names

The first 50 or so years of a Pearl's life is a confusing mess of vicarious experiences, stimuli, and rage. Their thoughts lack coherence and logic, and they react on impulse. Many Pearls are killed during this time and most don't last long. As such, the first sentient thoughts carry particular weight to a Pearl, and most name themselves after something related to this moment - for example, an item of food, a plant, an animal.

Others may inhabit a host for so long that they becomes emotionally or habitually attached to their host's name.

When two Pearls communicate, their minds and thoughts entangle, so they have little needs for names.

### Seeing the World

Pearl's see threats all around them. Should a pearl's mortal vessel meet an intimely end, they would die too. As such, they treat those they encounter with suspicion, ever worried that they will encounter one who can seeing beyond the host to the parasite within. Most of all, they fear encountering others of their kind - those who might best identify them, and who's knowledge might be greater than their own.

Pearl's see themselves as vessels of knowledge, and seek out new information voraciously, convinced that the next tome they scour will contain facts that may save their life at some point. They value new knowledge so highly that they will freely trade all their host's material posessions for a single fact, or even switch hosts to comb through that persons mind.

### Pearl Traits

Your pearl character has certain characteristics in common with all other pearls.

__Ability Score Increase.__ Your intelligence increases and wisdom increases by 2. You constitution decreases by 5.

__Age.__ Pearls mature slowly relative to humans and reach sentience by around age 50. They can live 1000 to almost 5000 years.

__Ancient Watcher.__ Pearl's remember almost everything they see over their long lives. You are proficient in History.

__Invasive Mind.__ As an action, once per 30 days, Pearls can try to invade the mind of another and switch hosts. The target must pass a Wisdom saving throw or be invaded. If the invasion fails, the Pearl remains in its current host, but the host can resist the Pearl once more, and has advantage on the next time they resist. They can target any humanoid of intelligence 10 or greater, of size Medium or less. They may invade the mades of other player characters.

The minds of the Pearl and the human cooexist in the same body, and the relationship between the Pearl and its host can either be collaborative or combative. The host can resist, but the Pearl gains full control after three consecutive failures and cannot be resisted. This resets if the Pearl ever voluntarily gives control back to the host.

The Pearl can be attacked directly via psychic damage, and all psychic attacks on the host are received by the Pearl. Calculate your hit points as normal. If the Pearl's hit points are reduced to 0, the Pearl dies without making death saving throws.

Additionally, Pearls have the cantrip Message.
