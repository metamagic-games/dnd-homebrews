### Brood Lifecycle

Once the egg of a Brood is laid, it takes a prime number of years between 100 and 500 years to hatch.

They emerge as mature adults, and it is their overwhelming mission to create offspring of their own.
Their desire to find a mate means they can be found everywhere and anywhere

Brood fill the nest with food for the larvae. To give their child the best chance, some brood bury the egg with weaponry and equipment for when they hatch. The more sentimental even leave heirlooms of their own lives or information about themselves.

These nests are potentially very vulnerable - some seek to find brood eggs to sell or enslave the brood, or even just to steal these treasures. The parents exhibits dramatic dimorphism, and their bodies grow dramatically after giving birth, with the brood becoming less mobile but much stronger and tougher, and the brood will often stay by the egg protecting the site.
