# Vakkyr

_The dwarf - at least I think it was a dwarf - stepped out of thin air. Black dagger in hand, she seemed to have cut through the very fabric of the universe. I knew her intent from those cold eyes - she had come for my life._

_Fear got the better of me, and I stumbled backwards and tripped. She was poised to strike me, when a great black claw reach out of seam in reality she had opened, and grasped her ankle. She let out a terrible scream and was dragged back into that void from which she arrived._

- Police report
