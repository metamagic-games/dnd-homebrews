## Spells that promote movement

Iâ€™ve been thinking about ways that spells could better promote movement on the D&D battlefield. Here are a few ideas.

### Life well

Spell, AoE heal
Create a 15 foot square around a target point. At the beginning of your next turn, each ally in the square heals 1D6 + 1D6/SL.
By designating an area ahead of time, you give your allies a chance to move across the battlefield to receive healing, incentivising movement.

### Life link

Spell, Reciprocal damage
Concentration
Wis save
Range 30ft
Every time the caster takes damage, the target takes it as well. If the target leaves the range of the spell, it ends.
This gives a reason for adventurers to retreat from the caster.

## Healing

### Inner Peace

- 1st turn - 1D4 + 1D4/SL healing
- 2nd turn - 2D4 + 1D4/SL healing
- 3rd turn - 3D4 + 1D4/SL healing
