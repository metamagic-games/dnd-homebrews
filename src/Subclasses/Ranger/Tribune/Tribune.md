### Ranger Archetypes

At 3rd level, a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype feature. The following options are available to a ranger, in addition to those offered in the Playerâ€™s Handbook: the Tribune. 

## Tribune

Though most with magical abilities embrace their talents, some fear the power of the magic they hold. That fear consumes some, and many lose or never develop their latent magic abilities. As a fear of magic consumes these cursed few, they find the cannot help but to negate and consume magic, and are even able to turn spells upon their original casters.

Tribune are rare and their abilities are prized: they make ideal assassins for magic-weilding targets, as well as powerful Rangers in lands where magic creatures run rampant. Young Tribunes are often forced into servitude as body guards or hitmen by those who fear magic. This servitude, and the deeds they are forced to perform, take their toll on a Tribune.

A Tribune's self-hatred undermines and isolates them, and after years of wandering alone, hunting the arcane, they may come across as damaged and unhinged, even insane. However, they will protect their allies fiercely, even in the face of terrifying power.

#### Tribune Magic

You have no magic powers of your own, and __cannot learn any spells__ - even spells conferred upon you by multi-classing, patrons or through other magical means. Any spells you already know are lost to you. However, Spells can be added to your spell book through the __Arcane Well__ feature. Magic items can be used as normal.

Your spell book many only contain a number of spells equal to your Ranger level (_e.g. at level 4 you may store 4 spells_). Spells you cast are removed from your spell book.

Any magic you have absorbed disperses when you rest. All spells are lost when you take a short or long rest.

#### Arcane Well

Though you cannot learn spells of your own, you have a rare ability to store, and even manipulate, the magic of others.

Whenever you are you are the target of a spell, you may use Arcane Well as a reaction.

Make an ability check using your Wisdom modifier with DC equal to 12 + the spell's level (make this before any check or saving throw you would normally make as the target of this spell). On a success, you absorb the magical energy and the spell has no effect. Add the spell to your spell book.

Spells cast with a critical roll cannot be absorbed.

If your spell book is already full or you fail to absorb a spell with Arcane Well you take (an additional) D4 damage per level of the spell.

#### Consume Magic

You may remove a spell from your spell book as a bonus action. If you do so, regain hit points equal to D4 + the spell's level.

#### Reckless

-1 AC

#### Arcane Tracker

You are attuned to the arcane and can intuitively sense magic around you. You can use the spell __Detect Magic__ at will. It does not count as a spell to you.

\page

> ##### Detect Magic
> _1st-level divination (ritual)_  
> __Casting Time:__ 1 action  
> __Range:__ Self  
> __Components:__ V, S  
> __Duration:__ Concentration, up to 10 minutes  

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

#### Mage Slayer

You have practiced techniques useful in melee combat against spellcasters, gaining the following benefits:
- When a creature within 5 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
- When you damage a creature that is concentrating on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its concentration.
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet of you.

#### Improved Arcane Well

You can extend your magic-negating abilities outside of your body.

Arcane Well can be used whenever you are in the area of effect of a spell (such as a cone effect spell) even if you are not they specific target of that spell.

You can cast Antimagic Field once per long rest. This does not count as casting a spell.

#### Preserve Magic

When you take a short rest you may retain one spell of your choice in your spell book.

All other spells are removed as normal.


#### Predict Magic

You often sense a spell being channelled before it is cast. You can choose to warn one target of any spell, including than yourself, giving that target advantage on any checks caused by that spell. This includes advantage on the check triggered by using __Arcane Well__.

This feature may be used as many times per long rest equal to your wisdom modifier.

#### Disenchant Item

__Concentration:__ 1 hour

Make an Arcana check with DC corresponding to the rarity of the magic item (see below). If you succeed, you are confident you can disenchant this item. After an hour of concentration, you have succeeded in breaking the enchantment, and the item becomes a non-magic item.

If you fail, you cannot try again.

The magic in some items if too powerful even for the most proficient adventurer. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can disenchant a given item.

##### Disenchantment DC
| DC | Cookie Type |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 8  | Common |
| 12  | Uncommon |
| 16 | Rare |
| 20 | Very Rare |
| 24 | Legendary |
