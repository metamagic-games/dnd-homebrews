## Otherworldly Patrons

At 1st level, a warlock gains the Otherworldly Patron feature. Here is a playtest option for that feature: the Gambler.

### The Gambler

Your patron is a mysterious entity that takes great enjoyment from observing the goings on of your plane of existence. Your patron revels in demonstrations of particular skill or luck. They will lend you aspects of their power, but using those powers is rarely simple, usually involving elements of chance. If your patron takes a particular shine to you, they may even twist fate to your favour.

#### Roleplaying a Gambler

A key element of a gambling patron is making bets. You may make a bet with your patron which they may or may not choose to take, or vice versa. Bets might include: _"I bet I can kill this enemy by round 3 of combat"_, _"I bet I can steal this item as a tribute to you, oh mighty patron"_, or _"I bet I can finish this fight without taking damage."_.

These bets should have agreed upon rewards, such as damaging an enemy on a success, or giving you gold. Bets should also have agreed upon punishments, such as taking away gold, or even forcing you to cut a finger off in tribute.

Discuss this element of gameplay with your dungeon master in advance.

Your patron compels you to accept any bets or games of chance you encounter on your adventures.

##### Gambler Expanded Spells

| Warlock <br>Level | Feature                  |
| :---------------: | :----------------------- |
|        1st        | Death Pact, Chaos Bolt   |

|        4th        | Confusion, Synchronicity |

#### Bonus Cantrips

At 1st level, you learn the guidance cantrip. It counts as a Warlock cantrip for you, but doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

#### Lucky

You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

You have 3 luck points.

Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker’s roll or yours.

If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled. You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

#### Inspired Luck

At the beginning of each day, roll a D6. If you roll a six, you gain an Inspiration Point.

#### Bend Luck

Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Once per long rest, when another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use a reaction to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

#### Gambler's Debt

Every time you roll a D20 (ignoring rolls which you re-roll):

- On a 1, lose all Inspiration Points and temporary hit points.
- On a 20, gain an Inspiration Point, 5 temporary hit points, and D4 gold pieces.

#### Risky Strike

You may forgo positive modifiers for an attack. If that attack hits it deals an additional D4 necrotic damage multiplied by the modifier forgone.

## Eldritch Invocations

#### Truthseer

_Prerequisite: 5th Level_
<br><br>
Honour is important to your patron, and lies physically pain you. Whenever you are lied to, take 1 psychic damage.

#### Patron's Luck

_Prerequisite: 9th Level_
<br><br>
Before roll any dice, you can choose to add 1D4 to that dice roll. If you do so, take 2d10 psychic damage.

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Prolific Gambler

You gain proficiency in all games (for example, _Three-Dragon Ante_). You know the rules and how to play all games.

## Spells

#### Death Pact

Target 2 creatures within range. Roll a D20 for each target. The target with the lower roll takes D10 necrotic damage per spell level.

**Variant rules:** Target 2 creatures within range. Using a deck of regular playing cards, draw one card for each target. The target with the lower card takes D8 necrotic damage per spell level.

#### Lucky Bolt

Using a deck of regular playing cards, draw 1 card per spell level:

- The number on the card corresponds to how much damage you deal (picture cards = 10, Aces = 11).
- The card's suit corresponds to the type of damage dealt:

* **Spades** - Slashing damage
* **Hearts** - Necrotic damage
* **Diamond** - Piercing damage
* **Club** - Bludgeoning damage
