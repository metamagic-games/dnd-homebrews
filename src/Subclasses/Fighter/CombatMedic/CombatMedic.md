# Fighter

## Martial archetype

At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype feature. Here is a playtest option for that feature: the Combat Medic.

### Combat Medic

Combat Medics are veterans of the battlefield, accustomed to the carnage and bloodshed of war. Combat Medics have learned how to save themselves and those around them from even the most grevious of injuries, and to protect those under their care from potential ones.

These expert fighters know when to attack, and when to retreat to care for the wounded. They've learned to scavenge for herbal remedies in even the most remote environments. Compelled by those they failed to save in the past, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to adventure where they are needed most.
