## Way of the Selfless

Monks of the Way of the Selfless follow a tradition that condones self-sacrifice for the greater good. In line with that mindset, they have developed a number of techniques that unlock the full capabilities of their bodies, risking death in the process.

Unleash the energy reserves of the body in rapid explosive bursts, providing superhuman speed and agility for but a moment.
No sooner is limit broken, that the energy reserve dries up,rendering the user a husk of their former self.

### Limit Break

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can choose to use Limit Break to push your body beyond its normal limits and perform incredible feats of speed and strength. When you move or attack, you can activate Limit Break as a reaction.

When you activate limit break, you immediately:

- Increase your exhaustion level by 1
- Gain 1 ki per level of exhaustion you now have

Until your next turn:

- You ignore the effects of exhaustion
- You add your Wisdom modifier to your rolls to hit and your damage
- You score a critical hit on a roll of a 19 or 20
- You have advantage on ability checks
- You can perform the dash action as a bonus action

### Exhaustion

The effect of the various increasing levels of exhaustion are below.

| Level |                     Effect                     |
| :---: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|   1   |         Disadvantage on ability checks         |
|   2   |                  Speed halved                  |
|   3   | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
|   4   |            Hit point maximum halved            |
|   5   |               Speed reduced to 0               |
|   6   |                     Death                      |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effeet that causes exhaustion, its current level af exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect ofits current level of exhaustion as well as alllower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with ali exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

### Endless Endurance

At 6th level, your body has adjusted to the toll you put on it and grown resilient. When you take a long rest, you recover 2 endurance points.

### Unrivaled Senses

By 11th level, you gain the ability to push your senses beyond their natural limits. When you would fail an ability check based on sight or hearing, you can re-roll and add your Constitution modifier.

If the ability check was based on sight, you are blinded.

If the ability check was based on hearing, you are now deafened.

You recover fully after a short rest. You must take a short rest before using this ability again.

#### Blinded

A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.

Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s Attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Deafened

A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

### Pressure Point

At 17th level, you gain the ability to damage the bodies of your opponent. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack. you can spend 1 ki point to attempt to strike a pressure point and cripple your target. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take a point of exhaustion.

# Designer Notes

## The Concept

The idea behind this subclass is to capture that anime trope (exemplified by Rock Lee in Naruto) of - just when the enemy thinks you're down - unleashing unbridled energy, but damaging your own body in the process.

## Considerations

This is a complex subclass to play. Limit Break provides an extremely powerful tool for the player, but using it too early in a fight or dungeon will leave the monk exposes.

Allowing a player to use this monk also requires consideration from the DM. Limit Break has potential to be exploited, if the player remains in situations where long rests are always feasible.
