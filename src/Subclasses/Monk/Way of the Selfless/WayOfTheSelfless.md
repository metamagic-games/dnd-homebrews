# Way of the Selfless

Monks of the Way of the Selfless follow a tradition that condones self-sacrifice for the greater good. In line with that mindset, they have developed a number of techniques that unlock the full capabilities of the body, but risk its integrity in the process

### Limit Break

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can choose to use Limit Break to push you body beyond its limits and perform incredible feats.

When you activate limit break:

- Take 1d6 - constitution modifier damage
- Gain a point of exhaustion

For the duration of your turn:
- Advantage on attacks
- Advantage on ability checks
- You ignore the effects of exhaustion for this turn
- You can perform the dash action as a bonus action

### Exhaustion

The effect of the various increasing levels of exhaustion are below.

| Level | Effect |

| 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks |
| 2 | Speed halved |
| 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6 | Death |
