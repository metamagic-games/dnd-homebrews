## Monastic Traditions
 
At 3rd level, a monk gains the Monastic Tradition feature. Here is a playtest option for that feature: the Way of the Shadow Realm.

###Â Way of the Shadow Realm

The Shadow Realm is a mysterious plane of existence where restless the spirits of monsters, dragons, and even gods, battle endlessly. The Way of the Shadow Realm teaches its students to channel the powers of these spirits, and harness their power for offensive and defensive purposes. A Shadow Realm master can even banish an unsuspecting enemy to the Shadow Realm.

These Monks carry a deck of artefacts representing the spirits they conquer, and often wear mysterious puzzles (that look really heavy).

Playing as a Monk of the Way of the Shadow Realm requires Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.

#### Way of the Shadow Realm Features

##### Spirit Bonds

You have can convene with spirits of the Shadow Realm, and you carry a deck of artefacts (Yu-Gi-Oh! cards) symbolising your connections to these spirits.

When you make a long rest you may choose to convene with a spirit of a level equal to or less than your own. Make a wisdom check DC it's highest stat out of Attack and Defence. If you succeed, you seal the spirit - add it to your deck.

Your deck may contain a number of spirits equal to twice your level.

##### Call on Spirits

You can only use spirit whilst they are in your hand, rather than your deck. At the beginning of each of combat turns, draw a spirit from your deck. 

As a bonus action, you may draw a spirit from your deck.

Once you utilise the power of a spirit, it must rest before it can aid you again. Once a spirit is used, place it in your discard pile. Your discard pile is re-added to your deck after a long rest.

##### Gift of the Mystical Elf

You can spend 1 Ki point to borrow the power of a spirit and bolster your defences. Play a card from your hand. You gain temporary hit points equal to the Defence of the spirit divided by 200. Place the spirit in your discard pile.

For example, Millenium Shield, with Defence 3000, would confer 15 temporary hit points. 

##### Dark Strike

You can spend 1 Ki point to borrow the power of a spirit for an attack as a bonus action. Play a card from your hand. Your next attack this turn deals extra damage equal to the Attack of the spirit divided by 200. Place the spirit in your discard pile.

For example, Blue Eyes White Dragon, with Attack 3000, would deal an additional 15 damage. 

##### Heart of the Cards

When you draw a card, you may spend 1 Ki point to place that card at the bottom of your deck and draw a new card.
