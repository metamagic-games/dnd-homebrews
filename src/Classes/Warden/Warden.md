# Warden

What is the raw magic Necromancers tap into? What is the essence of life that Druids access within nature? By what channels do divine beings restore life to the faithful?

At some point in a Warden's life, they were brought to the precipice of death, only to survive the experience. However, they never truly left death behind either. Caught in a limbo between life and death, Wardens have learned to harness this proximity to death, leveraging the terrible understanding they'vw gain from their experience.

Wardens gain their connection through a proximity to death.

### Masters of Life and Death

Wardens understand and access the essence of life itself, and can manipulate it through a raw connection to that essence.

Most of all, Warden's can govern and manipulate their own soul, appearing differently to others,...

### On the edge of death

Death is something that remains with Wardens

### Creating a Warden

As you create a warden, the most important thing to consider is the circumstances of your near-death. As your warden levels up, they begin to remember how they survived death, what they saw in that moment, and, crucially, how they died. It is this event that defines who your warden is today, and as your character begins to piece together what happened to them, their influence over life and death grows more potent.

Also consider who you were before that event. How much did your death change you?

### Spellcasting

As you learn to tap into the energies governing life and death, you can cast warden spells.

| Warden Level | Spells |
| Cantrips | spare the dying, resistance, mage hand, minor illusion, stabilise, chill touch, true strike, guidance |
| 1st | bane, healing word, inflict wounds, fog cloud, dancing lights, dissonant whispers, silent image, sleep, unseen servant, sanctuary, protection from evil and good |

| 7th | death ward |
| 9th | mass cure wounds, raise dead |

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the warden spell list. You learn additional warden cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warden table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Warden table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of warden spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the warden spelllist. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your warden level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of warden spells requires tapping into the fabric of death and communing with spirits. It requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list, and you take 1d4 - 1 damage per spell prepared.

#### SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells. The power of your spells comes from the strength of your soul. You use your Constitution whenever a warden spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### RITUAL CASTING

You can cast a warden spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. To cast a spell as a ritual, you must add 10 minutes to the spell’s casting time, during which you take 1d4 necrotic damage per spell level.

#### SPELLCASTING FOCUS
You can use your relic of a past life as a spellcasting focus for your warden spells.

### Soul Essence

When you miraculously came back from the brink of death, you discover something about your soul's very essence. Choose 

#### Essence Spells

Each Essence has a list of spells - its essence spells - that you gain at the warden leveis noted in the essence description. Once you gain a essence spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a essence spell that doesn't appear on the warden spellist, the spell is nonetheless a warden spell for YOU.

Even communing with the dead.

You’ve had a soul-shaking realization: you’ve been dead before, yet somehow you are alive again. This life isn’t your first; it might not even be your second. Your past life, or lives, are unclear to you, but you know that you passed through the gates of death. And the powers of death, or some other influence, wasn’t done with you. 

Whatever force brought you back, you now know the truth about yourself: that you are one of death’s representatives among the living.
