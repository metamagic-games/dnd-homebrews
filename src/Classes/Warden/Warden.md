## Warden

What is the raw magic that Necromancers tap into? What is the essence of life that Druids access within nature? Through what channels do divine beings restore life to the faithful? 

At some point in a Warden's life, they were brought to the precipice of death, only to survive the experience. However, they never truly left death behind either. Caught in a limbo between life and death, Wardens have learned to harness this proximity to death, leveraging the terrible understanding they'vw gain from their experience.

Wardens gain their connection through a proximity to death.

### Masters of Life and Death

Wardens understand and access the essence of life itself, and can manipulate it through a raw connection to that essence.

Most of all, Warden's can govern and manipulate their own soul, appearing differently to others,...

### On the edge of death

Death is something that remains with Wardens

### Creating a Warden

As you create a warden, the most important thing to consider is the circumstances of your near-death. As your warden levels up, they begin to remember how they survived death, what they saw in that moment, and, crucially, how they died. It is this event that defines who your warden is today, and as your character begins to piece together what happened to them, their influence over life and death grows more potent.

Also consider who you were before that event. How much did your death change you?

\page

#### Casting Spells

The Warden table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

The power of your spells comes from the strength of your soul, and whenever you cast a spell, you consume some of that life-force. When you attempt to cast a spell, you first take 1d4 of damage. This damage does not interup your concentration.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells.

You use your Constitution whenever a warden spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a warden spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. To cast a spell as a ritual, you must add 10 minutes to the spell’s casting time, during which you take 1d4 necrotic damage per spell level.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use your relic of a past life as a spellcasting focus for your warden spells.

### Soul Essence

It was this unique aspect of your soul which saved you from death. Choose one of the following options: Resilient Soul, Vengeful Soul, Undying Soul, Elusive Soul.

#### Essence Spells

Each Essence has a list of spells - its essence spells - that you gain at the warden leveis noted in the essence description. Once you gain a essence spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a essence spell that doesn't appear on the warden spellist, the spell is nonetheless a warden spell for YOU.

#### Essence Feature: Soul Nature

#### Last Gasp

When you are within 5 foot of a corpse, as an action you can create a link with a spirit through their corpse. When you do so, you cast the _speak with dead_ spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Speaking with the dead in this way temporarily gives you a capability from a past life — you’re unsure whether it’s from your past or the spirit’s. When the spell ends, you gain one random benefit from the Borrowed Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Lingering Lifeforce

You learned that the souls of the dead do not immediately leave the body. When you are within 5 foot of a corpse that died within the past hour, you can use an action to harvest the remaining life force still lingering within. Gain hitpoints equal to 1d4 per that target's constitution modifier + your constitution modifier. You gain one random benefit from the Borrowed Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

This ability can only be cast once on a given corpse.

#### Pain of Death

You learned the excruciating experience that death truly is.

When a creature within 15 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to share the pain with others. Cast bane for free on all nearby targets. You gain one random benefit from the Borrowed Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

When your health is lower than your constitution modifier, you can use an action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to see that space to teleport to it, but your teleportation fails, wasting your bonus action, if you attempt to teleport through magical force that is Medium or larger, such as a wall of force.

If you appear in a space occupied by another creature or filled by an object, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are shunted.

#### Deathly Parlay

Powerful undead entities stand beside you and attempt to repel other undead forces. When your health is lower than your constitution modifier, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. lt also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Audience with Death

You can converse with the forces of death itself. You have advantage on death saving throws, and whenever you make a death saving throw, your spirit can ask an entity of death a question that can be answered with “yes,” “no,” or “unknown.” The entity answers truthfully, using the knowledge of all those who have died.

Even communing with the dead.

You’ve had a soul-shaking realization: you’ve been dead before, yet somehow you are alive again. This life isn’t your first; it might not even be your second. Your past life, or lives, are unclear to you, but you know that you passed through the gates of death. And the powers of death, or some other influence, wasn’t done with you. 

Whatever force brought you back, you now know the truth about yourself: that you are one of death’s representatives among the living.
