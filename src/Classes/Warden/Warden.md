## Warden

What is the raw deathly magic that Necromancers tap into? What is the essence of life that Druids access within nature? Through what channels do divine beings restore life to the faithful?

At some point in a warden's life, they were brought to the precipice of death, only to survive the experience. However, they never truly left death behind. Caught in a limbo between life and death, Wardens have learned to harness this proximity to the essence of life, leveraging the terrible understanding they've gain from their experience.

### On the edge of death

You’ve had a soul-shaking realization: maybe you’ve been dead before, yet somehow you are alive again; maybe you were almost killed, but survived by the skin of your teeth. One thing is for sure: who you are now is not who you once were. Your past life, or lives, are unclear to you, but you know that the shadow of death looms close by.

Through whatever means you survived your near-death experience, you now know the truth about yourself: that you are one of death’s representatives among the living. This is something that remains with Wardens throughout the rest of their lives. At times, it is a curse, distancing them from those around them, and at times, it is a blessing, giving them power over life itself.

### Masters of Life and Death

Wardens understand the essence of life and death, and can access and manipulate them through their raw connection to this force. Wardens gain their connection through both their knowledge and insights of the other side, and an inner power that resides in their soul.

### Creating a Warden

As you create a warden, the most important thing to consider is the circumstances of your brush with death. As your warden levels up, they begin to remember how they survived death, what they saw in that moment, and, crucially, how they died. It is this event that defines who your warden is today, and as your character begins to piece together what happened to them, their influence over life and death grows more potent.

Also consider who you were before that event. How much did your death change you?

Make sure you have a lingering illness or injury?

\page

#### Casting Spells

The Warden table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

[Note that you do not need to prepare spells?]

The power of your spells comes from the strength of your soul, and whenever you cast a spell, you consume some of that life-force. When you attempt to cast a spell, you first take 1d4 of damage. This damage does not interup your concentration.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells.

You use your Constitution whenever a warden spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

__Spell save DC__ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
__Spell attack modifier__ = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a warden spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. To cast a spell as a ritual, you must add 10 minutes to the spell’s casting time, during which you take 1d4 necrotic damage per spell level.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use your relic of a past life as a spellcasting focus for your warden spells.

### Soul Essence

From 1st level, your soul's essence becomes apparent. When you miraculously came back from the brink of death, it was this unique aspect of your soul which saved you. Choose one of the following options: Resilient Soul, Vengeful Soul, Undying Soul, Elusive Soul.

#### Essence Spells

Each Essence has a list of spells - its essence spells - that you gain at the warden levels noted in the essence description. If you have a essence spell that doesn't appear on the warden spellist, the spell is nonetheless a warden spell for YOU.

#### Essence Feature: Soul Nature

At 2nd level, you gain an ability related to your soul's true nature.

#### Essence Feature: Inner Power

At 13th level, you gain a further ability related to your soul's true nature.

#### Essence Feature: Last Gasp

At 17th level, you gain a further ability related to your soul's true nature that manifests when you die or reach the brink of death.

### Mark for Death

When you reach 3rd level, you can mark a target within 15ft as a bonus action, cursed by dark necrotic energies. They must take a constitution saving throw or become marked for death.

Targets marked for death remain so until they take a long rest, or you mark another target.

The target has the following disadvantages:
- Whenever the target is healed, that healing is reduced by 1d4.
- Characters have advantage on intimidation checks against the target.

If a marked target dies, gain 1d12 health.

#### Reap

When you deal damage against a marked target, you may reap as a reaction, draining both of your life forces. When you reap, you deal an additional 1d6 plus your constitution modifier to both the target and yourself.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Deathly Insights

Beginning at 5th level, you learn something about the nature of death, and are able to exploit it. At your closest to death, you saw and understood an aspect of the nature of death and the dead. Choose one of the following options.

#### Last Gasp

When you are within 5 foot of a corpse, as an action you can create a link with a spirit through their corpse. When you do so, you cast the _speak with dead_ spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Speaking with the dead in this way temporarily gives you a capability from a past life — you’re unsure whether it’s from your past or the spirit’s. When the spell ends, you gain one random benefit from the Borrowed Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Lingering Lifeforce

You learned that the souls of the dead do not immediately leave the body. When you are within 5 foot of a corpse that died within the past hour, you can use an action to harvest the remaining life force still lingering within. Gain hitpoints equal to 1d4 per that target's constitution modifier + your constitution modifier. You gain one random benefit from the Borrowed Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

This ability can only be cast once on a given corpse.

#### Pain of Death

You learned the excruciating experience that death truly is.

When a creature within 15 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction to share the pain with others. Cast bane for free on all nearby targets. You gain one random benefit from the Borrowed Capabilities table. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Borrowed Capabilities

| d3 | Capability |
| :-: | :-: |
| 01 | You learn how to speak, read, and write one language of your choice. |
| 02 | You gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice. |
| 03 | You gain proficiency with one saving throw of your choice. |

### Uncanny Cadaver

Beginning at 7th level, you can:
- Cast feign death once without expending a spell slot
- Cast the reverse of feign death - feign life - on a corpse
- Disguise a corpse as the corpse of another

### Brush with Death

Beginning at 10th level, you remember how you died or came to the brink of death.

You gain the ability to project a vision of this experience into the minds of others. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warden spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all frightened by you until the end of your next turn. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Spectral Vision

Beginning at 11th level, you can sense undead and ethereal creatures within 30 feet, even behind walls.

### Allies in Death

Beginning at 15th level,You have communed with the dead so frequently that, when at death’s door, spirits of the dead come to your aid. Choose one of the following options.

#### Ethereal Jaunt

Sprit guides come to your aid, and you have the ability to slip in and out of the Ethereal Plane. When your health is lower than your constitution modifier, you can use an action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to see that space to teleport to it, but your teleportation fails, wasting your bonus action, if you attempt to teleport through magical force that is Medium or larger, such as a wall of force.

If you appear in a space occupied by another creature or filled by an object, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are shunted.

#### Deathly Parlay

Powerful undead entities stand beside you and attempt to repel other undead forces. When your health is lower than your constitution modifier, each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. lt also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Audience with Death

You can converse with the forces of death itself. You have advantage on death saving throws, and whenever you make a death saving throw, your spirit can ask an entity of death a question that can be answered with “yes,” “no,” or “unknown.” The entity answers truthfully, using the knowledge of all those who have died.

### Undead Resilience

Beginning at 18th level, your time spent among spirits and undead has toughened you body and resolve. You gain resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and you become immune to the frightened condition.
