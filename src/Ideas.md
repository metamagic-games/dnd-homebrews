# Ideas

Something
- Every time this class deals damage, gain 3 temporary hit points
- Extra hit points on kill
- As the temporary hit points accrue, gain other abilities. 
- Also consume temporary on some abilities

Totem master
- Lay down healing and damage totems
- Floating damage totems that can shoot lasers

Reaper
- Cleave attacks
- Whenever you kill an enemy, summon a skeleton

Other ideas
- lay down a speed boosting line, like Tyrael
- Teleporting
- On receiving damage, gain invisibility
- Deal +1 damage for each 10 hit points lost
- Damage spell in line that does more damage the more enemies it passes through
- Double movement while unseen
- Poison-based class
- Fighter that can attack three times sucecessively. Each successive attack deals more damage
- Something that removes the disadvantage on attacks of opportunity
- When reduced to below half health, gain 3d8 temporary hit points
- Void prison - 20 foot square freeze, can’t damage, can’t be damaged
- Write a collection of “When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points…”
- Character that loses health each turn but gains huge healing on kill
- Use Shadar-Kai
- Qhira + Sonya + Stitches as a character
- Bonus action: bless a character. Action: heal all blessed characters
- Heal that heals yourself for 1d8, but others for 1d4. Maybe gets extra actions whilst at full health? Or has resistance.
- Warlock: Consume health to restore a spell slot! Lich as a patron?
- Blink in, make actions, blink out at end of turn
- Statue - can’t take damage while as a statue, apart from by large target. If you take damage from a large target, you die forever
- Grenade - explodes, knock all in range back 5
- Lunge - Move 5 forward then make attack
- Half movement of all things in combat by default?
- Make 1d4 damage attacks over and over until you miss
- Reaction: teleport 5 
- Create pillars, and leash target to pillar, rope them in and they take damage - kelthuzad
